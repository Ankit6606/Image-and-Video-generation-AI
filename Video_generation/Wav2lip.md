# 🗣️ Wav2Lip: Realistic Lip Sync from Audio

**Wav2Lip** is an AI model that generates **realistic lip movements** for a silent or mismatched video using a provided **audio clip**.

It aligns the **speaker’s mouth** to match the given speech, even if the original video had no sound.

## 🧠 How Wav2Lip Works

| Component         | Function                                               |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎞️ **Input Video**   | A video of a face speaking (can be silent)           |
| 🔊 **Input Audio**   | A speech audio file (usually `.wav`)                 |
| 🧠 **Lip Sync Model**| Analyzes the audio and generates appropriate mouth shapes |
| 📤 **Output Video**  | The original video but with lips synced to the audio |

Wav2Lip uses a **GAN (Generative Adversarial Network)** trained on thousands of video-audio pairs to ensure **smooth and realistic** lip synchronization.
