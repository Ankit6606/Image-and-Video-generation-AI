# 🌀 What Are Diffusion Models?

Diffusion models are **generative models** that learn to create data (like images) by reversing a noising process. In simple terms:

> They learn to start from **random noise** and gradually **denoise** it to form a realistic image.

## 🧠 Core Idea: Learning the Reverse of Noise

1. **Forward Process (Adding Noise):**

   - Take a real image (like a cat).
   - Gradually **add Gaussian noise** to it over many steps (say, 1000).
   - After many steps, you get **pure noise**.
   - This process is **known** and doesn’t require learning.

2. **Reverse Process (Denoising):**

   - Now train a neural network to do the **reverse**:
   - Given noisy data, predict the **original image** at each step.
   - The model learns this reverse denoising process during training.

## 🧪 Training Phase (What Happens During Learning?)

1. **Input:** A clean image from the dataset (e.g., a dog picture).
2. **Noise Injection:** Randomly add noise to it at a random time step `t`.
3. **Model Task:** The diffusion model is trained to predict either:

   - The **original image**, or
   - The **noise** that was added (common in DDPM).

4. **Loss Function:** Measures how well the model predicts the target (usually Mean Squared Error - MSE).
5. **Repeat:** This happens for thousands of image samples over many epochs.

## 🧙‍♂️ Generation Phase (How It Makes New Images)

1. **Start from random noise** (a tensor of values sampled from Gaussian distribution).
2. **Apply the trained reverse process step-by-step:**

   - At each step, the model predicts the cleaner version of the image.
   - The image becomes **progressively sharper and more detailed**.

3. **Final output:** A realistic image that didn't exist before.

## 🎨 Text-to-Image Diffusion (Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, etc.)

1. **Conditioning on text:** Use **CLIP** or **Transformer encoders** to convert a text prompt (like “a panda on a skateboard”) into a vector.
2. **Inject this into the diffusion model:** So the denoising is **guided by text**.
3. **Result:** The image gradually forms to match the text prompt.
